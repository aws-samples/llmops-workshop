    "Conversational interfaces such as chatbots and virtual assistants can be used to enhance the user experience for your customers.Chatbots uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries. Chatbots can be used in a variety of applications, such as customer service, sales, and e-commerce, to provide quick and efficient responses to users. They can be accessed through various channels such as websites, social media platforms, and messaging apps.\n",

      "  Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for his theory of relativity and the famous equation E=mc². Einstein's work had a profound impact on the development of modern physics and laid the foundation for many of the technological innovations of the 20th century, including nuclear power, GPS, and lasers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Einstein was born in Munich, Germany, to a Jewish family. He grew up in a middle-class family and showed an early interest in science and mathematics. He studied at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, where he graduated in 1900 with a degree in physics. After completing his studies, Einstein worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, where he developed his theory of relativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1905, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers that introduced his theory of special relativity, which challenged the traditional understanding of space and time. In 1915, he expanded on this theory with his general theory of relativity, which described how gravity works and predicted phenomena such as gravitational waves and black holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Einstein's work had far-reaching implications for physics and astronomy. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which is the phenomenon by which electrons are emitted from a metal surface when it is exposed to light. He also made important contributions to the development of quantum mechanics and the philosophy of science.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout his life, Einstein was known for his unique perspective on the universe and his ability to explain complex scientific concepts in simple terms. He was a strong advocate for peace and human rights, and he was involved in various political and social causes throughout his life. Despite his many accomplishments, Einstein remained humble and unassuming, and he continued to work on scientific problems until his death in 1955.\n"

    "Enterprise search has shown tremendeous values in helping people in an organization find the information they need to perform their jobs. \n",
    "With the rise of AI based enterprise search (intelligent search), the new paradigm enables organizations to gain better insights and offer employees a more dynamic experience.\n",
    "For example, rather than using the standard keyword search for information, users can leverage natural language queries to find more accurate and semantically relevant results, therefore drastically improve customers and employee experiences.\n",
    "An intelligent search system requires a knowledge based repository, typically a vector database to allow for fast and accurate similarity search and retrieval of data based on their vector distance or similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous lab, we created an embedding model and hosted on SageMaker. In this lab, we'll focus on converting the knowledge source (i.e. documents) into vector representations using the embedding model, and a ingest the vectors into an Amazon OpenSearch server cluster. \n",

    "\n",

    "- Process and split them into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Create a numerical vector representation of each chunk using SageMaker embedding model\n",
    "- Create an index using the chunks and the corresponding embeddings\n",

To do this we apply a pattern called RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation): the idea is to index the corpus in chunks, then look up which sections of the corpus might be relevant to provide an answer by using semantic similarity between the chunks and the question. Finally the most relevant chunks are aggregated and passed as context to the ConversationChain, similar to providing a history.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a csv file and use **Titan Embeddings Model** to create vectors for each line of the csv. This vector is then stored in FAISS, an open source library providing an in-memory vector datastore.

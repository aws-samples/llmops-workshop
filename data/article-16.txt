 <title>Dog Befriends Stray Cat in Park</title>

<content>
A heartwarming story unfolded yesterday at the local park, where a dog named Cooper befriended a stray cat. 

Cooper, a 2-year-old Golden Retriever, was enjoying his usual afternoon walk with his owner, Sarah, when they came across the cat near a bench. At first, the cat was shy and kept its distance. But Cooper slowly approached and began wagging his tail in a friendly manner. 

After a few moments, the cat allowed Cooper to get close and the two began playing together, chasing each other around trees and taking turns pouncing. "It was amazing to see," said Sarah. "The cat went from being scared to bounding around with Cooper like old pals."

According to Sarah, Cooper has always loved making new friends, both canine and feline. "He's just a really gentle, loving soul," she said. Sarah hopes the cat can find a permanent home, but in the meantime is happy Cooper could offer some companionship.

The two played for over an hour before the cat wandered off again. But Sarah says she's excited to return to the park soon and see if the new friends reconnect once more.

 <title>Major Earthquake Strikes California</title>

<content>
A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Southern California late Tuesday night, causing widespread damage and triggering fears of a larger quake in the coming days. 

The quake, which struck at 11:46 PM local time, was centered in the Mojave Desert about 20 miles north of Barstow. It was felt across a wide swath of Southern California as far south as San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico. 

In Los Angeles and Orange Counties, the shaking lasted for nearly a minute. Highrises swayed and freeways buckled. Power was knocked out to over 2 million residents. Numerous gas leaks led to structure fires in downtown L.A. 

The earthquake comes on the heels of a 6.4 magnitude tremor that hit the Ridgecrest area on the Fourth of July. Seismologists have warned that these could be foreshocks preceding an even bigger temblor on the San Andreas Fault.

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency and requested a federal disaster declaration. He urged residents to prepare for potentially powerful aftershocks that may continue for days or weeks.

The quake was felt as far away as Phoenix and Las Vegas. No tsunami warning was issued by the National Weather Service.

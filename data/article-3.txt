 <title>Local Dog Wins National Frisbee Competition</title>

Fido, a 6-year-old golden retriever from our hometown, won first place at the National Dog Frisbee Competition held last weekend in Indianapolis. 

Fido competed against over 50 dogs from across the country in freestyle flying disc contests that test the dogs' athleticism, training, and bond with their handler. Fido and his owner Jane Smith have been training together since Fido was a puppy. 

For the final freestyle flying disc routine, Fido leaped over hurdles, caught discs behind his back, and jumped into Smith's arms to catch discs thrown between her legs. The audience cheered wildly as Fido nailed the challenging routine perfectly.

"I'm so proud of Fido," said Smith. "We've worked hard for this moment but it's all been worth it. Fido just loves playing frisbee so much." 

Fido and Smith take home the national title, a large trophy, and a year's supply of organic dog treats. Locals hope to celebrate Fido's winning performance at a hometown parade later this month.

Sleepy Hollow, USA - An alien invasion was foiled this week thanks to the quick thinking and bravery of Sleepy Hollow's sheriff, John Doe. 

The invasion began at approximately 3AM on Tuesday when a large, saucer-shaped spacecraft was spotted hovering over the center of town. Several dozen small, grey-skinned aliens then emerged from the ship and began terrorizing locals. 

"They were grabbing people right out of their homes using some kind of tractor beam," said eyewitness Jane Smith. "I've never been so scared in my life."

Sheriff Doe quickly sprang into action, rallying a small force of deputies and brave citizens to fight back against the invaders. After a tense standoff, the aliens retreated back to their ship and left Earth's atmosphere. 

"I'm just doing my job and protecting my town," said the humble Sheriff Doe at a press conference. "But let this be a warning to any extraterrestrial visitors - don't mess with Sleepy Hollow!"

The thwarted alien invasion has made national headlines, with Sheriff Doe praised as a hero. Sleepy Hollow residents say they can sleep soundly knowing their stalwart sheriff is on guard against future attacks from the stars.

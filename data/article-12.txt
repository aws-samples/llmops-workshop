 <title>Local Woman Wins Pie Eating Contest</title>

<content>
Our small town is buzzing with excitement after Betty Smith, a lifelong resident, won the county fair pie eating contest last night. Betty, a 42-year-old florist, said she trained for months leading up to the big event. 

"I started small by just eating an extra slice of pie after dinner every night," she said. "But in the last couple weeks before the contest, I was eating entire pies in one sitting to stretch out my stomach."

According to eyewitnesses, Betty plowed through an entire cherry pie in just under 2 minutes, beating out 6 other contestants for the $500 cash prize.

"We are all so proud of Betty," said her husband, Jim Smith. "She really showed how much heart our little town has." 

Betty said she plans to use the prize money to take her family on a vacation, but she's also eyeing the county fair hot dog eating contest next summer. "I've got a year to get ready," Betty said with a grin. "Just wait until next year!"

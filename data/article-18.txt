The annual dog festival in the town of Pleasantville drew its largest crowd ever this past weekend. An estimated 5,000 people and 2,500 dogs attended the popular event held in Pleasantville Park.

The festival featured dog contests, agility demonstrations, pet adoptions, and dozens of booths offering the latest dog products, treats, and accessories. A highlight was the costume contest, where dogs dressed up in creative costumes like hot dogs, pirates, and princesses as they vied for prizes.  

Several local animal rescues and shelters also participated, holding meet-and-greets to help visitors find their perfect adoptable pet. Shelter volunteers reported meeting dozens of potential adopters and expect many dogs to find new forever homes thanks to the festival.

In addition to the pet-related activities, visitors enjoyed live music performances, local food trucks, a beer garden, and more. Festival coordinator Jane Smith said the event's continued growth is a testament to the community's love for dogs. 

"It's so heartwarming to see people and their pets coming together, having fun, and supporting animal welfare," said Smith. "We're already looking forward to making next year's dog festival even bigger and better."

Overall, the festival provided a full day of fun for dog lovers in Pleasantville and raised over $10,000 for local dog charities through vendor fees and donations. Organizers say they are grateful to the festival's sponsors for helping cover costs to keep the event free and accessible to all.
